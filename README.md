# VBA-challenge
I worked with my tutor and studygroups to come up with the final solution that I have for the VBA challenge.

As per instructions I have - 
Created the ticker symbol
Calculated yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
Calculated the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
Calculated the total stock volume of the stock.
And added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

I have also enabled the script to run through all worksheets.
